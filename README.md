# diir

## A cli navigation tool with functions

```bash
npm i -g diir
```

Lists sub-directories based on where you run

Fuzzy search to navigate to deeper sub directories or Functions

Functions include:

- Back - to go back to parent directory
- Code - open directory in vs code
- Quit - quit diir

Still WIP @0.0.3
