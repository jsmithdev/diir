# diir

## A cli navigation tool with functions

```bash
npm i -g diir
```

Lists directories where you run it

Fuzzy search to navigate to sub directories

Added to directory choices are:
Back- to go back
Functions- to run functions

Functions include
Code - open in vs code
Quit - quit diir 

Still WIP @0.0.2
